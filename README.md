#  step-by-step 
1. Provision the RDS PostgreSQL instance: Ensure your RDS PostgreSQL instance is up and running. Note down the endpoint, port, database name, username, and password.  <br>
2. Create a Kubernetes Secret: Store the database credentials in a Kubernetes Secret to securely provide them to your applications.<rds-postgres-secret.yaml >  <br>
3. On your terminal encode the username and password using base64. You can do this with the following commands:
echo -n 'your-username' | base64   <br>
echo -n 'your-password' | base64   <br>
4. Create a ConfigMap for the Database Configuration: Store the non-sensitive configuration details like the endpoint and database name in a ConfigMap. <rds-postgres-config.yaml> <br>
5. Update your Deployment to Use the Secret and ConfigMap: Configure your Kubernetes deployment to use the Secret and ConfigMap. <my-app-deployment.yaml>
6. Ensure Network Connectivity:   <br>
Make sure your Kubernetes cluster can reach the RDS instance. This might involve:  <br>
Ensuring the RDS instance is in a publicly accessible subnet or within the same VPC as your Kubernetes cluster.  <br>
Configuring security groups to allow traffic from your Kubernetes nodes to the RDS instance on the PostgreSQL port (default is 5432).  <br>
# 7 How to Deploy your application in this order
kubectl apply -f rds-postgres-secret.yaml  <br>
kubectl apply -f rds-postgres-config.yaml   <br>
kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yaml     <br>

# Here's a recap of the setup without

RDS PostgreSQL Instance: Hosted on Amazon RDS, managing its own persistence.
Kubernetes Secrets: Used to store sensitive information like database credentials.
Kubernetes ConfigMaps: Used to store non-sensitive configuration details like the database endpoint and name.
Deployment Configuration: Ensure your application deployment uses the Secrets and ConfigMaps to connect to the RDS instance.
Network Connectivity: Ensure proper network configuration for your Kubernetes cluster to communicate with the RDS instance. the RDS and K8S cluster should share thesame VPC.
